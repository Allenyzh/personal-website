Welcome to my personal corner on the internet.

This site is my **digital resume**, **project showcase**, and occasionally a **blog** where I write about what I'm learning, building, or thinking as a developer.

## Why Astro?

I built this site with [Astro](https://astro.build) because I wanted:

- **Fast performance** â€” Nobody waits for a slow portfolio.
- **Static site** â€” Reliable, secure, and deployable anywhere.
- **Component flexibility** â€” Easy to scale and customize.
- **Markdown-friendly** â€” Writing blogs feels smooth.
- **Framework agnostic** â€” Bring in React, Vue, Svelte as needed.

Astro hits all the right notes. It ships minimal JavaScript by default and only hydrates components when necessary. That means fast page loads, even on slow connections.

## Tech Stack

| Layer         | Tech Used                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Framework     | [Astro](https://astro.build)     |
| UI Components | React + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI |
| Blog System   | MDX / Content Collections        |
| Deployment    | Oracle Cloud Free Tier           |
| Versioning    | Git + GitHub                     |

## Site Structure

- `/` â€” Homepage with quick intro and highlights
- `/projects` â€” Project gallery with descriptions and links
- `/blog` â€” Posts like this one
- `/contact` â€” Ways to reach me (Email / Telegram / etc.)

## Notable Features

Some geeky details I enjoyed building:

- Styled with Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for clean and customizable components
- Blog posts are powered by Astro Content Collections

## Final Thoughts

This site is more than just a portfolio â€” it's my sandbox for testing tools, trying ideas, and documenting my growth. Whether you're a recruiter, a client, or a fellow dev, I hope this gives you a glimpse into who I am and how I build.
